Serial Breadth First Search - C++

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing a graph data structures. It starts at the root (or some arbitrary node of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors. This repo presents a standard STL-Queue based BFS Algorithm.
